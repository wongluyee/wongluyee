### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lu Yee

My name is Lu Yee and I'm a web developer based in Tokyo, Japan but originally from MalaysiaðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾
I love and am obsessed with coding.
I started my coding journey out of curiousity, watching some tutorial videos on YouTube. After falling in love immediately I'm pursuing it as a career.
To me, coding is like solving puzzles and I love solving puzzles! (I can do Sudokus and fiddle with a Rubik's Cube all day)
