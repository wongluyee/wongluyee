### Hi there 👋 I'm Lu Yee

I am a web developer. I love and obsess about coding.
I code in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I love books📚 (avg 50 books per year) and movies🎬 (avg 4 movies per month). Numbers are declining because I code more now 🤓 You can always find me in a bookstore or cinema 🙂
